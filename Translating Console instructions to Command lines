#task 1; is basically about starting up the project, so we will leave that alone

#Task 2: Confirm that needed APIs are enabled
#to check if the required API's are enabled for this project, we run the following codes on the command line 
	gcloud services list --available


#Task 3: 	Start a kubernetes engine cluster 
# to make things easier and reduce latency we export the zone of the kubernetes engine
	export MY_ZONE=us-central1-a
# to start a Kubernetes cluster managed by Kubernetes Engine.
# which we will name webfrontend and configure it to run on 2 nodes
	gcloud container clusters create webfrontend --zone $MY_ZONE --num-nodes 2
# to check what version of kubernetes is running 
	kubectl version



#Task 4:	Run and deploy a container
# to launch a single instance of the nginx container
	kubectl create deploy nginx --image=nginx:1.17.10

#to view the pod running the nginx container:
	kubectl get pods

#to expose the nginx container to the Internet:
	kubectl expose deployment nginx --port 80 --type LoadBalance

#to view the new service:
	kubectl get services

#to scale up the number of pods running on your service:
	kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas 3

#to confirm that Kubernetes has updated the number of pods:
	kubectl get pods

#to confirm that your external IP address has not changed:
	kubectl get services
